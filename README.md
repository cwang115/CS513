# CS513
This is the course project for CS513: Computer Networks
This networking project implements a client-server based chat application. The program was written in Java with Java Socket 
programming to run under the Windows operating system. The design and program are modular in nature and 
make maximum use of abstract data types for software reuse. The server can concurrently handle multiple 
clients by using multi-threading.
